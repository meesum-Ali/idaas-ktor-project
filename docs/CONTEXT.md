# Project Context

This project aims to create a lean and scalable IDaaS using Kotlin Ktor, promoting API-first design, domain-driven design (DDD), and clean code practices.

The project is designed with a stateless architecture for enhanced scalability and utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary data store, Redis for caching, and Docker for consistent deployment. It adheres to lean and agile methodologies, specifically following the principles of the Toyota Production System (TPS) and systems thinking, ensuring continuous improvement and rapid iteration.
