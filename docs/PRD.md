# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
The Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) project aims to deliver a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for managing user identities, stateless authentication, authorization, and compliance. It is designed as an API-first solution leveraging Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and clean architecture principles.

## Objectives
- Implement stateless, secure authentication.
- Provide comprehensive user and role management.
- Ensure efficient and effective policy-based authorization.
- Meet high standards for security, audit logging, and compliance.
- Maintain a lean and agile development approach.

## Features

### User Management
- User registration, login, and profile management
- Lifecycle management of users (creation, updates, suspension, deletion)
- Role and permission management

### Authentication
- Stateless JWT-based authentication
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect support
- Passwordless authentication options (magic links, WebAuthn)

### Authorization
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Policy management and enforcement

### Audit Logging and Compliance
- Structured and secure logging of all sensitive operations
- Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2 standards

## Technical Architecture

### Core Architectural Layers
- **Presentation Layer:** RESTful API endpoints via Kotlin Ktor
- **Application Layer:** Business logic, domain services, and use cases
- **Domain Layer:** Core domain logic, entities, value objects, aggregates
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Data storage, caching, and external integrations

### Data Flow
1. Client applications send requests through RESTful API endpoints.
2. API routes requests to the appropriate service in the application layer.
3. Business logic processes domain-specific entities.
4. Infrastructure layer interacts with PostgreSQL (primary database) and Redis (caching).
5. Responses are structured and sent back through API endpoints.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Kotlin Ktor
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Cache:** Redis
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
- **Observability and Monitoring:** OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, ArgoCD
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, Pulumi

## Methodologies and Principles
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Clear bounded contexts and domain models.
- **Clean Code Practices**: Maintainability, readability, adherence to SOLID principles.
- **Lean and Agile Development**: MVP-first development, continuous improvement (Kaizen), Just-in-Time (JIT) feature delivery.
- **Toyota Production System (TPS)** and Systems Thinking: Continuous improvement, eliminating waste, streamlined processes.

## Security and Compliance
- JWT-based stateless authentication for scalability and security
- AES encryption for data at rest
- TLS encryption for data in transit
- Robust audit logging to ensure compliance
- Privacy-by-design adhering to GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 compliance standards

## Deployment
- Docker containers orchestrated via Kubernetes
- Automated continuous deployment pipelines
- Configuration managed via Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets

## Scalability and Performance
- Horizontally scalable due to stateless service design
- Efficient caching mechanisms leveraging Redis
- Potential for database sharding and replication strategies
