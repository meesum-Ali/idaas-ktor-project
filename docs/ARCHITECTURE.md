# Architecture Overview

The Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) project uses a modern, scalable, and maintainable architecture following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles.

## High-Level Architecture

The project architecture is structured in clearly defined layers:

- **Presentation Layer (API Layer)**: Built using Kotlin Ktor for defining RESTful APIs.
- **Application Layer**: Business logic, domain services, and use cases.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains core entities, value objects, aggregates, and domain-specific logic.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles database interactions, caching, external integrations, and authentication mechanisms.

## Domain-Driven Design

The IDaaS architecture clearly separates concerns into distinct bounded contexts:

### Core Domain
- User Management
- Authentication & Authorization

### Supporting Subdomains
- Audit Logging
- Compliance and Monitoring

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Kotlin Ktor
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Caching:** Redis
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, ArgoCD
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, Pulumi
- **Authentication Protocols:** JWT, OAuth2, OpenID Connect

## Data Flow

1. Client applications send requests to the API endpoints exposed via Ktor.
2. Ktor routes requests to the appropriate application service layer.
3. Business logic is processed, interacting with domain entities.
4. Infrastructure adapters interact with PostgreSQL and Redis as required.
5. Responses are returned back through the API layer.

## Security and Compliance

- Stateless JWT-based authentication
- AES encryption for data at rest, TLS for data in transit
- Structured audit logging for compliance
- GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2 compliance considerations

## Deployment

- Docker containers managed by Kubernetes clusters
- Continuous deployment via automated pipelines
- Environment-specific configurations handled by Kubernetes config maps and secrets

## Observability

- Comprehensive logging and monitoring with OpenTelemetry
- Dashboards and alerts using Prometheus and Grafana

## Scalability and Performance

- Stateless services ensure horizontal scaling capabilities
- Efficient caching with Redis for performance optimization
- Database sharding and replication for PostgreSQL when required
