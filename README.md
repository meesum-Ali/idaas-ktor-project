# Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS)

An open-source, API-first Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) project built using state-of-the-art technologies, promoting lean, agile development and Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive, scalable, and maintainable identity management solution, featuring stateless authentication, role-based authorization, and compliance with security standards.

## Core Features

- **Stateless Authentication:** JWT-based authentication leveraging OAuth2/OpenID Connect.
- **User Management:** Clear definition and management of user profiles, lifecycle, roles, and permissions.
- **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for efficient policy enforcement.
- **Audit Logging:** Structured logging for compliance and security purposes.

## Technology Stack

- **Kotlin with Ktor:** Lightweight, performant backend.
- **PostgreSQL:** Robust, scalable relational database.
- **Redis:** High-performance caching and state management.
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent deployment environments.
- **Kubernetes:** Recommended for orchestration and deployment.
- **OpenTelemetry:** Observability, tracing, and metrics collection.

## Development Principles

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Clear bounded contexts, aggregates, and domain services.
- **Clean Code Practices:** SOLID principles, maintainable, testable, and readable code.

## Lean and Agile Methodologies

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Iterative and incremental development.
- **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen):** Regular feedback loops and improvement cycles.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT):** Feature delivery precisely when required.
